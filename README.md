## Getting Started
This repository aims to assist you in beginning work on a MERN stack application with a solid file structure as a foundation. To get started make a copy of this template repo for your project teams.

Since this project will hold both the client application and the server application there will be node modules in two different places. First run `npm install` from the root.
